# Catena Aurea
This is the Catena Aurea of Saint Thomas Aquinas in OSIS xml format. It was compiled from various public domain sources, including the CCEL rawtext. Sections have been compared with the original text to assess textual integrity.
## Contributing
You can contribute by proofreading the text, or suggest and/or implement better markup. Most of it was applied either by hand or through regex find-and-replace features. 
## Notes
From all source copies I could find, the preface of the gospel of John was missing. It is fairly short and I had access to the Latin original. I translated it using the same sources that were consulted by the editors and translators of this work when possible. I release this preface to the public domain in the same CC0 license.
